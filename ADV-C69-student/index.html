Well,here is your solution- Prithvi cafe. This place is everything you can ask for. A beautiful place, great food, comfy and not at all expensive. It’s right in Juhu so not far from famous places. It’s in walking distance from Jalsa. Place is always crowded so you have to go there and give your name for reservation. They ask for your contact number and when your table is ready you get a text message. You can also keep checking how much time is remaining by a link you get in a text message</p>

            <p class="text-muted" "text-left">The Jantar Mantar is an equinoctial sundial, consisting of a gigantic triangular gnomon with the hypotenuse parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument is intended to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and declination of the Sun and the other heavenly bodies.

There were five Jantar Mantars in India, of which the largest is in Jaipur which features many instruments along with the world's largest stone sundial.[1] At present only four Jantar Mantar exist, as the Jantar Mantar at Mathura was torn down just before Revolt of 1857. The Vrihat Samrat Yantra is a sundial that is claimed to give the local time to an accuracy of 2 seconds.[2] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

                <p>The Lion King presents the story of a lion cub’s journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. Simba begins life as an honored prince, son of the powerful King Mufasa . The cub’s happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle Scar murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog and Timon the meerkat and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne.</p>

                <p>Little princesses Anna and Elsa listen to a bedtime story from their father, who regales them with legends of an enchanted forest protected by the most powerful of spirits. The supernatural forces are elementals – air, fire, water, and earth – who conduct trivial magic in observance of the harmonies between two nations, bargained by the forest-dwelling People of the Sun and the royal army of Arendell. But when a battle breaks out, the land is swiftly cut off from the outside world, shrouded by an impenetrable mist, forcing the two peoples apart – but not before the kind king is saved by a mysterious voice. Not content with a cliffhanger, Anna and Elsa are further tranquilized by a lullaby from their mother.In the present day as adults (after the events of “Frozen”), Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) contend with the responsibilities of tending to their kingdom. Elsa still doesn’t feel as if she belongs, remaining concerned about her leadership skills, while Anna enjoys the fall weather with Olaf (Josh Gad), who now ponders the qualities of impermanence, the mocking attitude of nature as it transitions between seasons, and the wisdom that comes with aging. And Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) takes cues from his reindeer pal on how best to propose to Anna.</p>
